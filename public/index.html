      <strong>
        Starbase 18 is a continuous living lab in the making for and by students to actually put the circular theory into practise. The lab, a circular mini village, facilitates all sorts activities from learning to build eco tiny houses, to setting up a water efficient aquaponics system, to create a food forest, to build with hemp-crete, to setup a IoT forest fire warning system, to setup a solar array, to learn about Design Thinking, to feed guest with on-site grown bio foods, and much more… All (research) results of the lab are open source, therefor public domain and free to use for everyone. The lab will share these results via various online media. The lab will play an active part in connecting, interacting and sharing with the local community.
Both local and international students are welcome. International students can make use of the Erasmus+ travel grants or they can participate in an Erasmus+ project. Dutch VET (pre-bachelor) students can follow mandatory ‘Flexible modules’ like ‘How to coop with innovations and change’, ‘Sustainability in your profession’, ‘Agile craftsmanship’ and ‘Art & Design’. Also all sorts of internships are possible. For professionals it’s possible to gain officially recognized certificates.

Over time it is our goal to expand the living lab by restoring and repurposing more and more properties in the region. We also want to create a generic blueprint for how to successfully set up a Rural Living Lab for others to use for setting up there own. A successful pilot for starting to create such blueprint has been executed in NL already (Groningen)*

Starting up this project is not an easy task, it requires a lot of time and hard earned cash. The initial investment for purchasing the property and the land has been provided by private investors who believe in the value that SB18 can provide students, schools and rural regions. For bringing SB18 to the next level we need more funds and people, sponsor our cause via Patreon or send us an e-mail about possible sponsoring options.
